 <div style="color:#000000; font-size:24px;">Study Guideline:</div>
<p>1.You need a desk or a table with a lot of space. You also need good lighting, so that you're able to see what you need to be studying. This place should be somewhere quiet, where you can study without being distracted by the TV or other family members.</p>
<p>2.Study for 20 minutes at a time, and then take a 10 minute break so that the information sinks in. This is a tried and true learning method. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break, let the stuff you just learned sink in, and come back to it. Repetition is the key to studying well..</p>
<p>3.After you think you've learned everything you need to know, have a friend/family member quiz you on it, or make up a quiz for yourself, then hide your notes and fill it out. Take back your notes and correct your little quiz and see how you did. Did you get all the answers right, or do you need to study some more?</p>
<p>4.For most people, cramming (studying for something the night before) doesn't really work. Most people need a few days to review their notes for the information to really sink in. Don't cram, because even if you study properly, usually cramming doesn't work too well anyway.</p>
<p>5.Before studying the most important thing is to have confidence in yourself. Keep in mind that "I can do anything". Nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>6.Don't just sit around and study without any importance. If you really want to be top, first take steps to train yourself to become a good student. Try your level best.</p>
<p>7.Make note to use books as the primary resource for additional information as the Internet may not have reliable information..</p>
